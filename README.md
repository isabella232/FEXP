Fire Emblem XP

As stated back in 2011 on Serenes Forest: http://serenesforest.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=27369

<blockquote>The FEXP toolkit was BwdYeti's pet project for almost three years, the product of countless hours of research, trial and error. Numerous resources were utilised in its creation, and a great many hands are to be credited for making it possible.

However, in light of recent and repeated adversities, it has become evident that maintaining the security of these consolidated efforts is impossible under the current system. As such, the FEXP project will cease development immediately and the FE7x project will continue development in XNA.

What this means for you, the end-user, is that the incomplete FEXP package is now available! Under the new FEXP forum, you will find tutorials, scripts and packages as they are uploaded - and of course, the engine itself.

I look forward to seeing what you do with the package!</blockquote>


## FE Project

My brother-in-law and I have been working actively on our own Fire Emblem inspired game tentatively titled the Fire Emblem Project. Yeah, real original, right?

This project was on hiatus for a while, but we've started to finally make major breakthroughs in developing and enhancing Fire Emblem XP to work towards our goals. We're now officially starting to get chapters developed in-game and have largely modified many of the scripts and menus.

To that end I decided to create this Github project so I can better keep all my files and scripts organized and so I can revert back to old versions in case if I make any mistakes.

I will not be posting up the full raw code just yet. I'll strip our own additions out until our project is done. No spoilers; the Fire Emblem Project may be inspired by the series, and it will use Fire Emblem music, but it will have its own original storyline unrelated to Fire Emblem whatsoever.


## What About Super FEXP?

Yes, I'm well aware that Klokinator was in development of a project named Super FEXP (http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/super-fexp-fire-emblem-rmxp.95876/). Fact is, he stated back in February it'd be out in a few months. He's still saying that as of last month. It doesn't seem to be going anywhere fast.

If Klokinator has made some progress and is interested in my help, I'd be willing to look into it, but for now I'm going with updating FEXP myself. I've already made some important additions and am still working on more, and we've filled in numerous new class animations. I don't want to have to wait until Super FEXP is ready for us to finish this project.


## Credits

Major credits to Klokinator for the guide to FEXP: http://www.klokreations.net/t422-fexp-ultimate-tutorial-on-hold-currently

I may have been able to figure it out on my own, but it would've taken far longer without the guide.

Major credits to BwdYeti as well for producing the original FEXP and releasing it to the public.

Naturally, credits also to Nintendo and Intelligent systems for creating Fire Emblem in the first place.
